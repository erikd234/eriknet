HOME OF ERIKS PROJECTS.

# ORIGIN STORY:

For the longest time I have been making many different small repositories with different projects and technologies
for different internet projets.

I have finally come to the realization that this is a barrier to me writing code
since each time I have a tinkering idea and something I want to host and deploy
I end up going through the same project setup things over and over again.

Introducing eriknet...

This is my attempt to have ALL my projects hosted under one giant mono-repo.

If I ever have a tinker project. For example a little game, a home automation server
that I want to access. My travel blogs, my Journal application. I want ALL the code in
one giant repo so I dont have to set up a new project each time I build a little app for
the fun of it.

Of course I will organize these projects into their own folders. But I dont need to go through
the paces of making a seperate git repo each time.

We will try this out and see how it goes.

For hosting its easy.

I have my own deploy scripts for an ubuntu server + nginx + systemd to run on a
4 dollar droplet. And I can have all my domains behind nginx as a reverse proxy.

Life is simple.

Database stuff? I love sqlite and im gonna use that for everything.
I can easily have a seperate DB as needed for whatever project.

Languages? If I can get away with using GOlang I will since I love GOlang.

Otherwise I will use Javascript and probably as much vanilla JS as I can until its
feeling like spagetti code. My hope is to avoid compexity as much as possible.

# CURRENT PROJECTS

Nothing so far lol.

# TOP IDEAS

1. Host my Travel Blogs from Europe Trip
2. Simple Browser Games Library (Make some games up)
3. Eriks Thoughts library (A minimilist blog site for my public thoughts)
4. Home Page (What should somone see when they visit erikdahl.net or erikdahl.ca?)
5. Erik's Private Journals -> Code will be public but data needs to be private. I want my own private thought / journaling application
6. Erik's Poker Money Divider -> me and my Friends always play poker. This tool automates the process of figuring out who pays who.
